UN Semantic Ontology

This is a provisional ontology schema and sample instance set for use in attempting to capture the UN's various information classification activities. All of the classes and properties asserted here represent a best effort to rationalize the current and historic practices of the librarians and other information managers of the United Nations. We make no guarantees about completeness or accuracy.

unvoc.ttl is the main schema 

The instances folder contains previous attempts to organize ontology space from an instance perspective. Most of this is deprecated in favor of the URI scheme we adopted.
